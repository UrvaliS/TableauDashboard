This project is an analysis of my favorite T.V. show, “The Office.” I took data from a public database and automated the poll of that data to create a Pivot Table onto an Excel worksheet to show which characters in that show had the most dialogues with all the seasons and episodes combined.

To have access and to be able to edit and manipulate the data sets, download the Excel Worksheet in the folder above. 

Screenshot of Pivot Table below.
